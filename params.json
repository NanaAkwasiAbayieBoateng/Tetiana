  "body": "This is an example of accelerated learning by \"jumping in at the deep end\" ... a vastly better way to learn than via a university education.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tatiana's Manifesto\r\n\r\nThe impetus for this project was driven by a simple and absolutely compelling hour-long talk delivered by Tatiana Ivanova: [How to Become a Data Scientist in 6 Months -- A Hacker’s Approach to Career Planning](https://youtu.be/rIofV14c0tc) at PyData London 2016.  What is so compelling about Tatiana's Manifesto is that the principles do not just apply to Python or Data Science -- these same principles will apply to lifelong learning and the career transitions that knowledge professionals can expect for the next century or more.  It is an absolutely BRILLIANT Manifesto -- if you watch it, I will gaurantee that you will find it thoroughly compelling, in many different dimensions. \r\n\r\nThis particular repo is a work-in-progress [as almost all repos tend to be.] It was origninally forked from [the excellent open-source data science masters (OSDSM) curriculum github repository](https://github.com/datasciencemasters/go). The OSDSM breaks down the core competencies necessary to making use of data.  The original OSDSM is pretty awesome, although it will not be perfect for you -- that is the POINT.  YOU will learn more by developing your own curriculum than you can possibly learn by just following someone else's curriculum.  It is important not to start from scratch -- it is up to YOU to fork your own repo, aggressively seek ways to compare it against the best alternatives, find ways to accelerate the improvement of your curriculum and work assiduously on your particular career situation and knowledge gaps, steadily making your repo more perfect and a better starting point for someone else.\r\n\r\n### The Internet is Your Oyster -- Use the Difficulties You Encounter to Get Tougher and Perfect Your Ability To Learn How To Learn\r\n\r\nWith free and open source software as well as the GitHub community, MeetUps, Slack, hackathons, Stack Overflow, YouTube, Quora, MOOCs, Wikipedia, ebooks, blogs, online documentation, wikis -- all free, open communities, requiring nothing but ambition and solid EFFORT [to prove your merit to contemporaries with motivations similar to yours] -- as well as other high-quality and affordable low-priced training/content providers such as Udacity or O'Reilly's Safari -- how can you afford not to take advantage of accelerated, non-traditional educational alternatives?\r\n\r\n### The Motivation\r\n\r\nRight NOW, we need a LOT more Data Scientists ... that probably will not be true if you waste your next decade or so getting a bachelors, then a masters degree, then a Ph.D. The NEED is right now or maybe 6 months or a year from now -- but the need will change, just as the needs of industry will change.  The nasty secret of academia is that the pace of curriculum development is too slow AND is not responsive enough for the needs of the work that must be done ... and even if society needs people who we call 'data scientists' in five or ten years, the skills that those professionals will need to bring to the workplace will be far different from the skills that academicians believe are required today.  This has always been true to a small degree, but it is orders of magnitude more pronounced for the professions, like data science that are fundamentally about revolutionizing the way that humans solve new problems and invent new innovative industries. \r\n\r\n> ...by 2018 the United States will experience a shortage of 190,000 skilled data scientists, and 1.5 million managers and analysts capable of reaping actionable insights from the big data deluge.  THIS is a great statistic ... but even traditional education can develop impressive sounding degree programs, all of academia is still far too hidebound and bureaucratic -- it is certainly far, far too unresponsive to adapt to exactly what SKILLS [especially in the realm of rapidly evolving social skills such as online community building and social networking] that will be required by data professionals in 2018.\r\n\r\n-- [McKinsey Report Highlights the Impending Data Scientist Shortage](http://bit.ly/datascienceshortage) 23 July 2013\r\n\r\n> There are little to no Data Scientists with 5 years experience, because the job simply did not exist.\r\n\r\n-- David Hardtke \"How To Hire A Data Scientist\" 13 Nov 2012\r\n\r\n### An Academic Shortfall\r\n\r\nClassic academic conduits cannot provide Data Scientists -- this talent gap will be closed differently, different adaptations will make sense in different situations, but it will always be true the closure will happen in the most expeditious, the most accelerated fashion when individuals sieze responsibility for closing their own talent gaps.  People who need to have their progress affirmed by experts or need to behave as \"teachers pets\" cannot close this talent gap ... those can only regurgitate what they learn.  Genuine learning is not comfortable or entertaining; actually learning is HARD ...it is necessary to actually struggle with problems and \"build learning muscles\" stretching abilities in difficult attempts to close the gap in knowledge.  Most of the academic learning process is about racking up student loan debt while occupying space as a spectator on the sidelines of genuine learning.\r\n\r\n> **Academic credentials are important but not necessary for high-quality data science.** The core aptitudes – curiosity, intellectual agility, statistical fluency, research stamina, scientific rigor, skeptical nature – that distinguish the best data scientists are widely distributed throughout the population.\r\n\r\n> We’re likely to see more uncredentialed, inexperienced individuals try their hands at data science, **bootstrapping their skills on the open-source ecosystem and using the diversity of modeling tools available.** Just as data-science platforms and tools are proliferating through the magic of open source, big data’s data-scientist pool will as well.\r\n\r\n> And there’s yet another trend that will alleviate any talent gap: the democratization of data science. While I agree wholeheartedly with Raden’s statement that “the crème-de-la-crème of data scientists will fill roles in academia, technology vendors, Wall Street, research and government,” I think he’s understating the extent to which **autodidacts – the self-taught, uncredentialed, data-passionate people – will come to play a significant role in many organizations’ data science initiatives.**\r\n\r\n-- James Kobielus, [Closing the Talent Gap](http://bit.ly/closingthetalentgap) 17 Jan 2013\r\n\r\n### Ready?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## The Open Source Data Science Curriculum\r\n\r\nYour skills in studying and learning how to learn will resemble the skills of those who you train with.  If you want to be a data scientist, you have to begin thinking like a data scientist when it comes to approaching problems -- seek out different perspectives on [institutionalizing your own culture of data science](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-path-creating/9781491962633/) in your life.  \r\n\r\nDig in and get started, understand that you will be in \"over your head\" but get started. Don't worry if some of the topics seem beyond you at first -- the material will make sense as you work with it.  Get started, keep going, be patient with your ability to pick up the material, but just stay at it.   \r\n\r\n**Intro to Data Science** [UW / Coursera](http://bit.ly/uwintrodatascience)\r\n * *Topics:* Python NLP on Twitter API, Distributed Computing Paradigm, MapReduce/Hadoop & Pig Script, SQL/NoSQL, Relational Algebra, Experiment design, Statistics, Graphs, Amazon EC2, Visualization.\r\n\r\n**Data Science** / Harvard [Video Archive](http://bit.ly/harvarddatasciencevideos) & [Course](http://bit.ly/harvarddatasciencecourse)\r\n * *Topics:* Data wrangling, data management, exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses and intuition, prediction based on statistical methods such as regression and classification, communication of results through visualization, stories, and summaries.\r\n\r\n**Data Science with Open Source Tools** [Book ```$27```](http://bit.ly/book-datasciencewithopensourcetools)\r\n  * *Topics:* Visualizing Data, Estimation, Models from Scaling Arguments, Arguments from Probability Models, What you Really Need to Know about Classical Statistics, Data Mining, Clustering, PCA, Map/Reduce, Predictive Analytics\r\n  * *Example Code in:* R, Python, Sage, C, Gnu Scientific Library\r\n\r\n### A Note About Direction\r\nThis is an introduction geared toward those with at least **a minimum understanding of programming**, and (perhaps obviously) an interest in the components of Data Science (like statistics and distributed computing).\r\nOut of personal preference and need for focus, I geared the original curriculum toward **Python tools and resources**.
